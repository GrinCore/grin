# Grin Core

Grin Core is an in-progress implementation of the Core MimbleWimble protocol representing Core crypto values like Moon and Lambo. Many characteristics are still undefined but the following constitutes a first set of choices:

  * 21M Grins mined in the First 6 months - invest early and you shall be rewarded
  * 32MB blocks every minute - we want to be VISA but private
  * Proprietary PoW Pigeon Cycle - 100% ASIC proof
  * 20% time-locked premine, capitalistic development is the only one sustainable
  * Private presale for investors, we offer secret chain pre-mine for authorized farms
  * Transaction fees are based on the number of Outputs created/destroyed and total transaction size
  * GUI one-click wallet, node and miner**
  * Join our Discord!
  
## Proof of Work

We introduce revolutionary PoW aligned with the original vision of John Tromp and Cuckoo Cycle whitepaper. We want an algorithm that is latency bound and can be mined on a smartphone or a home computer. We want a community coin where everybody can participate and get rich.

## Status

We are running private test net ATM.

## Launch

June 2019 with Android, iOS, Mac, Win, Linux and BSD node+wallet+miner
